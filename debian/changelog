grml2usb (0.9.13) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Update documentation regarding syslinux and FAT32 (thanks to
    Stefan Traby <stefan@hello-penguin.com> for the hint).

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Mon, 21 Sep 2009 17:55:00 +0200

grml2usb (0.9.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace 'logging.*("%s" % foo)' with 'logging.*("%s", foo)'
    so the logging works with python2.6 as well.

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Thu, 10 Sep 2009 16:21:06 +0200

grml2usb (0.9.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve handling the 'No space left on device' situation through
    using an according rsync handler function.

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Mon, 07 Sep 2009 23:05:30 +0200

grml2usb (0.9.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support the directory where the grml2usb script resides as base
    directory so /usr/share/grml2usb isn't necessarily needed.
    Thanks for the patch to Alexander 'Leo' Bergolth <leo@strike.wu.ac.at>!
  * Make sure grub.conf isn't a symlink but a plain file instead,
    otherwise it will break on FAT16 filesystems. This works around
    grub-install of (at least) Fedora 10.
    Thanks for the patch to Alexander 'Leo' Bergolth <leo@strike.wu.ac.at>!
  * Use 'pci=nomsi' in failsafe bootoption. Thanks to Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt.
  * Mention the --syslinux option if grub-install fails.
  * Fix usage of --force in combination with --fat16. Thanks to
    Johannes Endres and Reiko Kaps for the bugreport.
  * Replace hint to '--grub' with 'grub'.
  * New option --grub-mbr which allows installation of grub in MBR instead
    of installation into a partition (PBR) which is necessary when using grub2.

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Mon, 07 Sep 2009 17:12:54 +0200

grml2usb (0.9.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use ascii.pf2 as grub2 font, since grub2 (1.96+20090307-1)
    the old ascii.pff isn't available anymore.
  * Use terminal_output if available, otherwise fallback to old
    older 'terminal'-command (thanks to Felix Zielcke for helping).
  * Document the 'grub-setup fails after Attempting to install GRUB
    to a partition instead of the MBR' issue.
  * Use "set gfxpayload=1024x768x16,1024x768" instead of vga=791 in
    grub2 configuration. This requires a recent version of the linux
    loader as the new linux loader loads the kernel at 32bit entry point
    and not at 16 bit anymore so it has to be translated for the Linux
    kernel (as the kernel parses vga= in 16 bit code). In the long run
    we don't seem to have another option, so let's change it.
    Thanks to Felix Zielcke and Robert Millan for first hand information.
  * Increase timeout from 5 to 10 seconds in grub2 configuration.
  * Load memtest86+ binary via 'linux16' in grub2 (otherwise it fails).
  * Drop the serial boot entry from grub2 (I assume users with usb
    pens don't need that option).
  * Change the way MirOS bsd4grml is loaded (use the fallback method
    as default).
  * Improve descriptions of grml's grub2 entries.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no further changes).
  * Fix creation and installation of grub1's configuration file (menu.lst).
    Thanks to Mario 'BitKoenig' Holbe.

grml2usb (0.9.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support installation on /dev/loop*-devices.
  * Generate configuration for syslinux and grub by default, no
    matter which bootloader the users chooses.
  * Added options --skip-syslinux-config and --skip-grub-config
    if someone wants to skip the generation of any bootloader
    configuration files.
  * Make sure grub-install is available before executing it.
  * Display information about default grml flavour and the other
    available grml flavours at the end of the grml2usb run.
  * Use /sbin/blkid (e2fsprogs) instead of vol_id as vol_id is going to be
    removed from udev. Thanks for the patch to Andras Korn!
  * Use rsync instead of cp. Thanks for the patch to Andras Korn!
    [Closes: issue683]
  * Use 'forensic' and 'readonly' in the forensic bootoption itself.
  * Spelling fixes (thanks to Thorsten Glaser <tg@mirbsd.org>).
  * Write GRUB2 config even if the target is a directory (thanks, Thorsten)
  * All these "set root=" are not needed for GRUB2 (thanks, Thorsten)
  * Switch order of check whether the specified device is a directory
    and check for usb device (as the usb device check will fail if
    it's a directory).
  * Add grml2iso for creating a bootable DVD:
    - thanks once more to Thorsten Glaser for helping and patches
    - thanks to Ernesto Domato for reporting the issue regarding
      i386<->amd64 with grub-mkimage

    - add 'grub-probe: error: unknown filesystem'
  * Support use with python version 2.4.
  * Bump Standard Version to 3.8.2 (no further changes).

  * Make sure to exit if installing grub fails.
  * Integrate hdt (Hardware Detection Tool) in bootsplash (but
    only if using syslinux as grub isn't supported).

 -- Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>  Mon, 04 May 2009 22:31:30 +0200

grml2usb (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: move kernel commandline from initrd to kernel option in
