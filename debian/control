Description: install grml system / ISO to usb device - compat version
 This script installs a grml ISO to an USB device to be able
 to boot from it.  Make sure you have at least one grml ISO
 or a running grml system (/live/image) available.
 .
 This package provides support for installation of older grml ISOs.
 Whereas the grml2usb package (without -compat) supports ISOs
 which are build using grml-live >=0.9.24 (grml releases >= 2009.10)
 this package is meant to be a compability package so
 installation of older ISOs is possible as well. This grml2usb
 version is expected to be work with current grml ISOs as well,
 though it lacks support for the new vesamenu based bootsplashes.
