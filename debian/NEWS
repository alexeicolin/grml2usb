grml2usb (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please notice that grml2usb was rewritten from scratch.
    The invocation of grml2usb changed. Instead of invoking:

        # grmlusb /path/to/iso /mnt/usb-sdb1

    from now on you can directly invoke it with the device, meaning:

        # grmlusb /path/to/iso /dev/sdb1

    The new release brings many new features (like multi-iso
    support, support for grub as bootloader, several new options).
    Check out the manpage for all the details.  Please let us
    know if you explore any problems or have any questions.
