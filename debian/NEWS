grml2usb (0.9.35) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this release, grml2usb-compat is no longer included.
  If you still need to install grml ISOs older than 2009.10, please use
  an older version of grml2usb.

  The dependency on lilo has been dropped, from now on only primary
  partitions will be flagged bootable.

grml2usb (0.9.13) unstable; urgency=low

  This release makes syslinux the default bootloader again.
  Grub fails just too often. Therefore the --syslinux options
  is deprecated and option --grub was introduced instead.

  This release provides decent support for multi-ISO within the
  new vesamenu bootsplash, providing a menu based system.  We had
  to break backward compatibility (otherwise the isolinux/syslinux
  code would be unmaintainable). Therefore support for older ISOs
  (everything before grml release 2009.10) had to be dropped. If
  you still need an old version of Grml on your usb device just
  use an older version of grml2usb (the old grml2usb versions
  support recent ISOs too, they just don't use/support the new
  vesamenu bootsplash then). The grml team supports old
  grml2usb versions through the grml2usb-compat script.
