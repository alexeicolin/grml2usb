grml2usb (0.9.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release makes syslinux the default bootloader again.
    Grub fails just too often. Therefore the --syslinux options
    is deprecated and option --grub was introduced instead.

  * This release provides decent support for multi-ISO within the
    new vesamenu bootsplash, providing a menu based system.  We had
    to break backward compability (otherwise the isolinux/syslinux
    code would be unmaintainable).  Therefore support for older
    ISOs (everything before grml release 2009.10) had to be
    dropped. If you still need an old version of Grml on your usb
    device just use an older version of grml2usb as well (the
    old grml2usb versions support recent ISOs too, they just
    don't use/support the new vesamenu bootsplash then).

grml2usb (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please notice that grml2usb was rewritten from scratch.
    The invocation of grml2usb changed. Instead of invoking:

        # grmlusb /path/to/iso /mnt/usb-sdb1

    from now on you can directly invoke it with the device, meaning:

        # grmlusb /path/to/iso /dev/sdb1

    The new release brings many new features (like multi-iso
    support, support for grub as bootloader, several new options).
    Check out the manpage for all the details.  Please let us
    know if you explore any problems or have any questions.
