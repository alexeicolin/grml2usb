TODOs
-----

* implement missing options (--kernel, --initrd, --squashfs, --uninstall)
* provide --create-partition[s] option
* provide --verify to check md5sums/sha1sums of files on usb device
* validate partition schema/layout: is the partition schema ok and the bootable flag set? (--validate)
* implement logic for storing information about copied files (register every file in a set())
* the last line in bootsplash (boot.msg) of syslinux should mention all installed grml flavours
  (attention, the line should become too long :))
* code improvements:
  - improve error handling wherever possible :) => especially disk full, any other known test cases?
  - use 'with open("...", "w") as f: ... f.write("...")'
* provide unit-testing (any ideas for useful/test-able scenarious?)
* provide progress bar when copying files
* provide graphical version; any volunteers? :)
